# Guide for Candidates to the Price Feed Council

Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the Price Feed Council.

1. **What is the Price Feed Council?**

    As defined in the adopted [Pyth DAO Constitution](https://github.com/pyth-network/governance/blob/main/docs/constitution/pyth-dao-constitution.md), the Price Feed Council is made of 7 members who are signers of the Price Feed Multisig Wallet. The Price Feed Multisig Wallet has powers to perform actions that are delegated to it by the Pyth DAO.

    The Operational PIPs delegated to the Price Feed Council involve:
       - the management of the list of price feeds available through Pyth; and
       - the selection of publishers and the setting of the minimum number of such publishers per price feed

    The execution of such actions by the Price Feed Council requires 5-of-8 approval (with one of the default multisig holders being the Operations Wallet itself)
&nbsp;

1. **How often are actions expected to need members’ involvement**

    ~10 actions per week
&nbsp;

1. **How many Votable Tokens are needed to nominate myself? or to get nominated?**

    0.5 basis points of the current Votable Tokens (standing at ~64,000 staked tokens as of March 5th)
