- Motivations to participate in the Price Feed Council
  - As a user and contributor who has consistently used and updated the price feed since the early launch of Pyth on zkSyncEra, We aim to further align with Pyth in the long term to enhance security and strengthen our partnership.
  - We plan to use the Pyth oracle on zkSyncEra and all of our future chain launches if possible, and we believe participating in governance will help further solidify our relationship.
- Relevant Experience
  - Launched in April last year as zkSyncEra's leading lending protocol, we have been periodically updating the Pyth price feed through automated bots, operating the lending protocol steadily without a single incident.
  - We are not an individual dev team but a blockchain tech firm composed of members with 6yrs+ of DeFi experience, ensuring stable operations without financial issues and swift problem-solving capabilities.
