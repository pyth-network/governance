- Motivations to participate in the {Pythian, Price Feed} Council
  - DropCopy parimutuel prediction game is a heavy user of Pyth. We have probabably built more custom infra to distribute the Pyth data than any other system other than Pyth Network itself.
  - Pyth is only just scratching the surface of what's possible with the protocol. I want to see it reach its full potential

- Relevant Experience
  - I have been a market maker with trading experience that has spanned almost every type of financial products from cash/spot to various derivative products.
  - I have built and certified many feed handlers from more exchanges (TradFi, CeFi, stocks, OTC) using several protocols (FIX, FAST, SBE, JSON, protobuf, ITCH/OUCH) than I like to remember.
  - Heavily involved in OpenBook and other DeFi projects that make use of Pyth.
