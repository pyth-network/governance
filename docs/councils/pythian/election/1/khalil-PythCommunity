As a long standing community member I understand how the Community is involved and drives the Pyth Network. This unique perspective allows me to assist in driving innovation within the network and ensuring that all stakeholders are considered in major decisions. 
In my professional life I am a Cyber Security analyst. This not only allows me to have high personal standards but will also provide benefits to the Council and the Pyth Network as a whole.
I am standing for election because I have a strongly held view that the entire diverse membership of Pyth Network should be represented on the Council.

I understand the importance of active engagement in shaping the Pyth Networkâ€™s future. Because of my ability and experience in fostering discussions, addressing queries, and promoting awareness of Pyth I was awarded the role of Ambassador in 2023.
With 15 years of experience as IT technician and consultant, alongside my cybersecurity qualifications, I bring a wealth of knowledge in securing digital systems. Specifically, my expertise lies in safeguarding data, mitigating risks, and ensuring the integrity of critical infrastructure.
I now have years of experience in Web3 and in DeFi. My enthusiasm for this transformative technology is unwavering. I aspire to continue to contribute to the decentralized finance (DeFi) world and drive innovation through effective collaboration, transparent dialogue and consensus-driven decision-making.
