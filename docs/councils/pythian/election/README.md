# Guide for Candidates to the Pythian Council

Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the Pythian Council.

1. **What is the Pythian Council?**

    As defined in the adopted [Pyth DAO Constitution](https://github.com/pyth-network/governance/blob/main/docs/constitution/pyth-dao-constitution.md), the Pythian Council is made of 8 members who are signers of the Pythian Multisig Wallet. The Pythian Multisig Wallet has powers to perform actions that are delegated to it by the Pyth DAO.

    The Operational PIPs delegated to the Pythian Council involve:

    - the upgrade of the oracle program
    - the upgrade of the verification program for each of the blockchains where Pyth data is accessible
    - the setting of data request fees per blockchain, as well as other protocol or network fees
    - the management of PGAS allocation and delegation to validators

    The execution of such actions by the Pythian Council requires 7-of-9 approval (with one of the default multisig holders being the Operations Wallet itself)
&nbsp;

2. **How often are actions expected to need members’ involvement**

    ~5 actions per week
&nbsp;

3. **How many Votable Tokens are needed to nominate myself? or to get nominated?**
