# PIP-1 : Adoption of the Pyth DAO Constitution

- Abstract:
    - This document ("PIP-1”) proposes the adoption of a decision framework for the Pyth DAO and the governing framework for the holders of $PYTH, the “Pyth DAO Constitution”, as formulated here: https://github.com/pyth-network/governance/blob/309c716599617971c6abb18f2097412d977b954f/docs/constitution/pyth-dao-constitution.md
    - Once the Pyth DAO Constitution adopted, the Pyth DAO will operate as outlined in the constitution.

- Rationale:
    - The Pyth DAO should adopt a clear framework regarding its governance, operations, and processes. The framework should fully inform its members of how the DAO functions and how $PYTH token holders relate to the DAO.
    - Through PIP-1, the Pyth DAO will have the ability to submit subsequent Pyth Improvement Proposals (“**PIPs**”), collectively decide on them and implement them, and delegate certain responsibilities to elected councils.

- Key Terms:

    PIP-1 proposes to adopt the Pyth DAO Constitution, a framework that:

    - sets rules and procedures on the submission and voting on PIPs
    - suggests the formation of two councils: the Pythian Council and the Price Feed Council which are respectively responsible for the voting and implementation of certain Operational PIPs as defined in the proposed constitution
    - lists a set of values and principles for the Pyth DAO community centered around ownership, governance, and inclusivity for the long-term benefit of the Pyth DAO

- Implementation Plan:
    - Approval of PIP-1

- Timeline:
    - PIP-1 is subject to a 7-day on-chain voting period from the time of posting in the Pyth Forum
